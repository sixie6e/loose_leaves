'''Vehicles/drivers kill 3700+ daily and that is not including wildlife or resources wasted and environmental garbage. People make too many trips in personal vehicles and most of the time those could wait until another trip to do everything at once, or are just existentially unnecessary. Hillbillies in trucks, motorcycle gangs, thugs in caddies on 22's, suburban mothers in suburbans, motorsports, citizens mindlessly mowing the lawn, so much damage is done(much of it uninentional, apathetic, conditioned behavior). "Buy gas thangs!", say the hillbillies and gas/oil corporations,. "Buy electric items!", say the virtue signaling corporate types....or...how about you just stop driving so goddamn much, sitting down to move around the planet, killing people and wildlife? Don't waste resources and purposelessly consume then cry about gas prices. Anthropocentric remedials.'''
